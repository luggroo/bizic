A thesis submitted by Yulou Zhou to the Department of Linguistics of Stanford University for the Honors Degree of Bachelor of Arts

Supervised by Paul Kiparsky and Dominic Yu

### Abstract
This study reconstructs the phonology of Proto-Bizic, the lowest ancestor language of the Bizic (Tujia) languages, a branch of the Tibetan-Burman languages spoken mainly in Western Hunan. This reconstruction uses four data points of Northern Tujia (tji) and two data points of Southern Tujia (tjs). 28 initials, 15 finals, 6 tones are reconstructed in a lexicon of 350 items. This study also discusses Bizic's placement under Tibeto-Burman.

### Erratum
1. Page 14 and 125. "Local chronicles in the PRC era indicates that Tujia-speaking small communities of tens to hundreds of people existed in Yongshun (Dǎdòngxī 打洞溪, Wángmù 王木 Township), ..." (p. 14) According to recent fieldwork done by Zhang Zhenhai 张真海 at Nanjing University, the language in Dǎdòngxī is a Chinese dialect closely related to the Humanao 蝴蚂鬧 dialect of Yuanling 沅陵
2. Page 112. "..., the aforementioned evidence of shared lexical innovation supports that the Bizic languages fall under the Niso-Burmish branch of Tibeto-Burman languages" should be corrected to "..., the aforementioned evidence of shared lexical innovation supports that the Bizic languages fall under the Niso-Burmish branch of Burmo-Qiangic languages"
