A thesis submitted to the Department of Linguistics of Stanford University for the Honors Degree of Bachelor of Arts 

### Abstract
This study reconstructs the phonology of Proto-Bizic, the lowest ancestor language of the Bizic (Tujia) languages, a branch of the Tibetan-Burman languages spoken mainly in Western Hunan. This reconstruction uses four data points of Northern Tujia (tji) and two data points of Southern Tujia (tjs). 28 initials, 15 finals, 6 tones are reconstructed in a lexicon of 350 items. This study also discusses Bizic's placement under Tibeto-Burman.
